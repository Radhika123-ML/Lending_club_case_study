## General Information
- Background:
The project revolves around predicting loan default for a consumer finance company specializing in various loans. Lending decisions play a crucial role in the company's success, balancing the need to approve loans for potential clients while minimizing the risk of defaults.

- Business Problem:
The primary business problem is to identify patterns and key factors influencing loan default. By doing so, the company aims to enhance risk assessment and portfolio management, reducing financial loss associated with defaulted loans.

- Dataset:
The dataset contains information about past loan applicants, including their attributes and loan performance. It encompasses approved loans with various outcomes such as full payment, ongoing repayments, and defaults (charged-off). Additionally, information about rejected loan applications is not available, as there is no transactional history for those applicants.

- Problem Statement
The project's goal is to predict loan default for a consumer finance company. The business problem revolves around minimizing financial loss associated with defaulted loans. Key aspects include understanding patterns influencing loan default and developing a predictive model for identifying potential defaulters. The project aims to provide actionable insights to enhance risk assessment and portfolio management, ultimately reducing credit loss.

- Analysis Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand the dataset's structure, key features, and distributions.
Identify patterns and relationships between consumer attributes and loan outcomes.
Uncover potential indicators of loan default through visualizations and statistical analysis




## Conclusions
- Prefer 36-month loan terms for lower default risk.
- Favor higher-grade and sub-grade applicants.
- Prioritize MORTGAGE and OWN home ownership.
- Give preference to verified loan applicants.
- Focus on debt consolidation purposes; be cautious with small business, moving, and house purposes.
- Prefer applicants with longer employment durations.
- Exercise caution with applicants having derogatory public records.
- Set competitive interest rates to mitigate default risks.
- Utilize a comprehensive approach considering multiple factors for risk assessment.
